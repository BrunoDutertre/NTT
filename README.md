## The Number Theoretic Transform

The Number Theoretic Transform ([NTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform_(general)#Number-theoretic_transform)) is an efficient algorithm for
computing the products of polynomials whose coefficients belong to
a finite field.

This repository contains SRI's various implementations of the NTT (developed while 
implementing the [Bliss](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/Bliss)).

It also includes the analysis of these algorithms.

The repository is organized into three subdirectories:

* src

* analysis 

* paper
