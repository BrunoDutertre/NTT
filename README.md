# NTT
The Number Theoretic Transform

The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is an efficient algorithm for
computing the products of polynomials whose coefficients belong to
a finite field.

This repository contains SRI's various implementations of the NTT (that were developed while 
implementing the [Bliss: The Lattice Signature Schemes](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/Bliss))
Bimodal).

It also includes the analysis of these algorithms.

The repository is organized into three subdirectories:

* src

* analysis 

* paper
